  abstract = {he differences between CMS, LMS and LCMS WRITTEN BY EDDIE BRAND. POSTED
	IN BEST PRACTICE Because the Internet can literally integrate every
	media, the creative possibilities of online learning are almost infinite.
	The expression can apply to an instant messaging conversation between
	two learners as well as a complex learning system that keeps the
	knowledge of a global corporation's whole staff using every media.
	From this perspective it is not surprising that not only hundreds
	of companies have specialized on online learning solutions, but also
	functional fields of work have differentiated. In the following we
	will make clear the basic differences between these software categories.
	Content Management System (CMS) – A framework for creating, publishing
	and tracking content CMS-ENGIdeally, a CMS is a system to collaboratively
	create, catalog, publish, edit and track content (also called learning
	objects). Content can be text, audio, picture and video files, but
	also lessons and complete courses. The content creation is very user-friendly
	and similar to popular software such as Microsoft Word or PowerPoint.
	Even for multimedia creation no programming skills are required.
	Furthermore, often various templates are provided. Content can easily
	be cataloged by using metadata (such as keywords). In the thereby
	emerging content database, these learning objects can easily be found
	and reused even in very diverse contexts. The efficiency of a CMS
	increases with the number of content producers and the complexity
	of the content combination. So, it's most usable for online platforms
	where a multitude of teachers create a comprehensive learning repertoire
	that is as complementary as possible. Popular CMS are Joomla, Drupal
	and WordPress. Learning Management Systems (LMS) – A framework for
	content distribution and managing users as well as tracking their
	behavior LMS-ENGIn comparison to a CMS a LMS is less about the management
	of a content database than about the management of a user database.
	Its usefulness consists of three fields: content delivery, user administration
	and behavioral tracking. Although content delivery also covers content
	management, it's primarily about an automated and individual delivery
	of occasionally complex modular learning content to users. Because
	usually the users have to register, their behavior can be tracked
	in a very sophisticated way, as well. On the one side, this allows
	simple track of progress and rating of performance, regardless of
	the number of learners. On the other side, this enables individual
	reminders for example for unfinished subtasks. While the usefulness
	of a CMS increased with the number of content producers, the usefulness
	of a LMS increases with the number of users and the complexity of
	their individual memberships. They might be in exclusive groups,
	for example. Beispiele für LMS sind Bluevolt, Litmos und BizLibrary.
	Learning Content Management System (LCMS) – An integrated solution
	LCMS-ENG.bmpLCMS (sometimes called ELMS for Educational Learning
	Management System) simply combine the features of a LMS and CMS.
	It's a system with which content can be created and stored, combined
	to lessons and courses as well as be managed – just as with a CMS.
	But similar to a LMS, it also allows managing users and tracking
	their behavior as well as rating their performance. Examples of LCMS
	are Xyleme, Blackboard and Kenexa. Conclusion As it is often the
	case with expressions, the transition between CMS, LMS and LCMS is
	smooth. That's why we limited this clarification on the fundamental
	differences. Furthermore, there are no generally binding guidelines
	for their use. Sometimes, a solution provider intentionally doesn't
	use the expression LCMS in order to advertize with the LMS with the
	most features. Additionally, it should be pointed out that a LCMS
	isn't the ultimate solution for every educational institution. Because
	not all popular formats are equally simple to integrate, the prizes
	vary also for these tailor-made solutions. And often it's the prize
	that makes the difference between luxury and opportunity.},

  abstract = {Scientifically Proven Brain Facts That You Should Consider Before
	you Develop Your Next eLearning Course While the content, layout,
	and navigability of your eLearning course are important; determining
	how a learner's brain actually acquires and retains information is
	an essential aspect of eLearning design and development. Without
	a firm grasp of how the brain works and the processes involved in
	learning new concepts, ideas, and skill sets, even the most experienced
	Instructional Designer will be unable to develop an effective eLearning
	course. Our brains do not have the capacity to multitask. For years,
	multitasking has been considered an all-important skill. However,
	research has found that our brains don't actually have the power
	to multitask. According to a 2009 study that was conducted in Paris,
	the participants’ brains actually worked at half capacity when they
	were asked to multitask [1]. In essence, one hemisphere concentrated
	on one task, while the other focused on completing the secondary
	task.As such, it typically takes the brain twice as long to complete
	an assignment or task, and your error rate goes up by about 50%.
	This is because we aren't “multitasking” at all, but “context switching”.
	As such, when designing eLearning courses, it's essential to avoid
	eLearning modules, which ask the user to perform multiple tasks at
	once, as this hinders the overall learning process. Learning that
	is spread out over time drastically increases knowledge retention.
	A review of research studies related to learning techniques by John
	Dunlosky of Kent State University and a group of colleagues found
	that spaced learning, or distributed learning, was far more effective
	than studying or learning concepts in a shorter span of time [2].
	The report also found that assessing one's own knowledge before an
	exam, through self quizzes and summaries of the core content, can
	improve a student's overall performance.Multiple studies have also
	found that microlearning can deter cognitive overload, which occurs
	when the brain is forced to accept an abundance of data at any given
	time. Therefore, designing eLearning courses, which are geared toward
	delivering bite size chunks of knowledge at once, such as in shorter
	eLearning modules, can lead to more effective online learning (Chunking
	Strategies). Multimedia tools improve our brain's memory power. It's
	been proven through multiple research studies and surveys that multimedia
	in eLearning, such as images and video, not only engage the learners
	but also help them to actually remember what they've learned. Research
	cited in a report by Michelle Chau cites a number of examples of
	how interactive learning tools, such as ebooks, lead to improved
	knowledge retention [3].According to research, students who used
	ebooks that contained sound effects, music, audio narration, and
	images were able to retain and recite more information than those
	who were simply given traditional textbooks. Utilizing these ebooks
	also led to group collaboration and peer interaction, as the students
	did not have to sit quietly on their own and privately read the text.
	This is yet another example of how using multimedia elements can
	enhance an eLearning course and provide the end user with an improved
	educational experience. Our brains work best at certain times of
	the day. Giving learners the ability to learn anytime, anywhere with
	eLearning courses has its own unique set of advantages (What BYOD
	Means for e-Learning). One of the most significant advantages is
	the opportunity to tap into the power of our brains at times of peak
	efficiency, such as just after taking a nap or when first waking
	up in the morning (The Impact of Tiredness and Fatigue on Learning).A
	study conducted by German researchers found that quick naps could
	allow a learner's brain to acquire and retain information more effectively
	[4]. During the study two groups of participants memorized cards
	that contained illustrations. Then, they asked the first group to
	take a nap, and the second to remain awake during a 40 minute break.After
	the 40 minutes had passed, they had the participants memorize another
	set of illustrated cards. Those who took a nap during the break remembered
	roughly 85% of the images and patterns, while those who stayed awake
	only recalled 60%. It is believed that napping allows information
	to be moved to the brain's long-term memory storage centers, leading
	to improved data retention. Therefore, when creating your eLearning
	course, keep in mind that flexible class or module schedules will
	allow your students to learn more efficiently and actually retain
	the information you are providing. Game play helps to exercise (and
	motivate) our mental muscles. Believe it or not, playing games is
	actually good for your brain. Not only does it help to engage learners
	in the eLearning process itself, but it also serves to remedy the
	boredom that so often leads to unsuccessful learning experiences
	(Free eBook - How Gamification Reshapes Learning). A report that
	was released by Leicha Bragg of Deakin University details a study
	that was conducted in three different schools, which involved 240
	students [5].According to the research, students were more motivated
	to learn mathematics when the information was presented in a gaming
	format. Even their attitude toward the subject changed, as did their
	confidence regarding the various concepts involved. The students
	were also more motivated to learn the information, which improved
	their overall success and alleviated the boredom that is often associated
	with repetition (especially relating to problem solving). Our brain
	prefers images over text. Adding visual elements to eLearning courses
	enhances knowledge retention. According to neuroscience research
	that is referenced in John Medina's book “Brain Rules”, participants
	in studies only remember about 10% of information presented orally
	when they are tested 72 hours after instruction [6]. However, that
	number jumps by about 65% when an image is added to the learning
	process. The basis of this idea lies in the “Pictorial Superiority
	Effect”, which suggests that visual input is more likely to be recognized
	and remembered. As such, including images and pictures in the design
	of courses can help to boost retention and knowledge acquisition
	rates. If you are familiar with other Scientifically Proven Brain
	Facts that you would like to share with eLearning professionals,
	I highly encourage you to leave a comment along with references!},
